## **🥗 Global Food Waste Analysis (2018-2024)**
📊 *Data-driven insights into food wastage, economic impact, and efficiency across countries*



---

## **📌 Project Overview**
Food waste is a growing global problem, impacting both **economies and sustainability**. This project explores:  
✅ **Which countries waste the most food?**  
✅ **What food categories contribute the most to waste?**  
✅ **How has food waste changed over time?**  
✅ **Is there a correlation between total food waste and economic loss?**  
✅ **Which countries are most efficient (least waste per capita)?**

## **📌 Key Insights**
### 1️⃣ **Top Food-Wasting Countries**
- **Turkey** wastes the most food (~6.88M tons in 2024).  
- **Developed nations** have higher **per capita waste**.  

### 2️⃣ **Most Wasted Food Category**
- 🍏 **Fruits & Vegetables** contribute **35%+ of total waste**.  
- 🥩 **Meat & Dairy** waste is lower but results in **higher economic loss**.  

### 3️⃣ **Food Waste Over Time**
- 📈 **Food waste increased by 15%** from 2018 to 2024.  
- 🌍 Some countries reduced waste, while others worsened.  

### 4️⃣ **Correlation Between Waste & Economic Loss**
- 📊 **Strong correlation (0.97)** → Higher waste = Higher financial loss.  
- 💰 More **efficient countries** had lower economic loss per ton.
